# Overview and Purpose

This semester-long project is intended to give you an idea of what it's like to conduct statistical research in the real world without impacting your grade. By this I mean that we are collecting real data, it's likely to be "messy" and its real science, I genuinely have no idea what the results will be.

It will have several parts:

1.  Set up, exploring the meta data and setting up your final report (this week)

2.  Creating a set of simple linear models to understand how a single variable impacts State College temperatures

3.  Creating some more complex linear models to understand what impacts the temperatures at different locations

You will be creating a group report, structured so that there are clear parts that you individually contribute to.
